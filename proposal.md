## Project Proposal

### Problem
I can be pain stakingly time comsuming to find truthy articles skin care. So the @sciencedaily bot when given the keyward skincare will give you a truthy article on just that.

### Goals
My goal is to make getting truthy articles on skin care easier for everyone.

### Audience 

>DISCLAIMER: The sciencedaily bot only works in the Make School Students Slack Workspace

This sciencedaily slack bot is for anyone in the Make School Students Slack Workspace who is slightly interested in skin care and wanting to learn more.

# Existing packages I will use
- [Colly](http://go-colly.org/) - provides the method for how I will get the skin care article

- [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/) - enables me to deliver a skin care article

# Task Description
First I plan to get the skin care article using Colly. After that, I will set up the slack bot. Then, I will listen for the keyword `skin-care` in the slack bot and add the getArticle as a function. During development, I will add links in comments for "borrowed code" to give credit to the source. Lastly, I will deploy the  slack bot.
